# ThumbSim

### Assignment, class and language
This is the solution to the assignment **ThumbSim** of class **computer architecture,** written in C++ with my team member [Ehsan Moslehi](https://github.com/eca852).

### Requirements
For this assignment we had to build an ARM Thumb simulator in C++. To be honest, we were given the skeleton of the whole simulator and had to implement the right an correct working methods so that our simulator was able to interprete and execute ARM Thumb instructions. Our main task was to understand the skeleton of the simulator, the data structures we were given, how to code in C++ and how to read an official **ARM v7 Reference Manual** which had about more than 1000 pages. We had to find the right descriptions to the right instructions and to translate them into workin C++ code. Currently my team member Ehsan and I are working to finish the simulator in a way that it understands the whole ARM Thumb instruction set. To complete this assignment we only had to implement a small number of instructions.  

It is hard to say what is exactly my part of the work because my team member and I worked most of the time together on one computer and corrected one another.
